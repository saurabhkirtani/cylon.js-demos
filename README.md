These are a set of demos for Cylon.js - the JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing and interacting remotely with IoT Devices.

1.  arduino-blinky.js and pi-blinky.js : Getting started with Cylon.js on Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
2.  2-devices.js : How to add two devices to the same program.
3.  remote-servo.js : How to turn on a micro-servo remotely, using cloud-based IoT SDKs for IoT Hub (Azure) - cloud-to-device messaging. The message format being sent is in JSON - {"action":"start"} or {"action":"stop"}
4.  remote-pi-button.js : How to send data to cloud to analyse in real-time - device-to-cloud messaging. This sample uses Azure Stream Analytics and Power BI in addition to IoT Hub, to view the total number of times a button is pressed.
5.  This repo also contains a presentation on Cylon.js
